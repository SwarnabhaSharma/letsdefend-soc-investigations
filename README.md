# LetsDefend SOC Alert Investigations 🛡️

This repository contains my hands-on Security Operations Center (SOC) alert investigation writeups completed on the **LetsDefend SOC platform**.  
Each investigation documents my end-to-end analysis process, decision-making, and final verdict for simulated real-world security alerts.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate my practical SOC skills, structured thinking, and documentation practices as a fresher SOC analyst.

## 🧠 Investigation Methodology

For every alert, I follow a structured SOC workflow:

1. **Alert Overview**  
   - Alert type, severity, and initial context  

2. **Initial Triage**  
   - Identification of indicators (URLs, IPs, hashes, domains, email artifacts)  

3. **Deep Analysis**  
   - Log analysis, reputation checks, payload inspection, and behavioral analysis  
   - Correlation with known attack techniques where applicable  

4. **Verdict & Reasoning**  
   - Malicious / Benign / Suspicious determination  
   - Clear justification for the decision  

5. **Response & Closure**  
   - Recommended actions and alert closure rationale  

This approach closely mirrors real-world SOC analyst workflows.
