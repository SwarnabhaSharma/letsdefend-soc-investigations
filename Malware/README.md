# Malware Analysis & Threat Investigation Lab

This folder contains malware samples and investigation reports analyzed as part of my hands-on training in Security Operations Center (SOC) operations, malware analysis, and threat detection.

The purpose of this lab is to simulate real-world SOC analyst workflows by analyzing malicious files using industry-standard tools and documenting findings in a structured, incident-response format.

# Objectives

* Perform static and dynamic malware analysis
* Identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
* Investigate attacker infrastructure and communication
* Analyze network traffic and malware behavior
* Map findings to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
* Develop SOC-level incident investigation skills

---

# Analysis Environment

The malware samples were analyzed in an isolated and controlled lab environment using the following tools:

* ANY.RUN
* Wireshark
* VirusTotal
* Hybrid Analysis
* Process Monitor
* Process Explorer
* TCPView
* Strings analysis
* Base64 decoding
* Windows Event Logs

---

# Investigation Methodology

Each investigation follows a real SOC workflow:

1. Initial malware execution
2. Process activity analysis
3. Network traffic analysis
4. File system changes review
5. Registry persistence check
6. Credential exfiltration analysis
7. IOC extraction
8. MITRE ATT&CK mapping
9. Incident summary and verdict
